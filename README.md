# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis
NLP: Sentiment Analysis
In this exercise, you are tasked with implementing a Text Classifiers to categorize news items. The dataset
name and link:
• 20newsgroups dataset (A collection of 20,000 news items across 20 categories)
• Available via Scikit-Learn Datasets API.
• Subset the dataset to only the following two categories named as ’sci.med’ and ’comp.graphics’
The preprocessing tasks are as follows:
1) Preprocessing textual data to remove punctuation, stop-words (list available via external libraries
such as NLTK and spaCy).
2) Implementing a bag-of-words feature representation for each text sample
3) Implementing a TF-IDF feature representation for each text sample
4) Split the dataset randomly into train/validation/test splits according to ratios 80%:10%:10%
In this exercise, you are tasked with implementing a Naive Bayes Classifier to categorize news items. The
Naive Bayes assumption is conditional independence of the features when modeling for the label.
1) For both preprocessing types train and validate the Naive Bayes Classifier to classify each news item
to the two categories named above.
2) Report the test set accuracy.
Please refer to the Scikit-Learn library for implementation of SVM classifiers. You are required to replace
the classifier in Exercise 1 with SVMs.
1) Tune the different SVM kernel choices provided by Scikit-Learn, and other associated hyperparameters for validation set.
2) Report the test-set accuracy.
